# Map Search Visualization

A small project I decided to write that took inspiration from learning search algorithms in my class. This project aims to visualize how the search algorithms spread when searching for a solution and shows the final solution that the algorithm chose. I think its better to see the example on a real map instead of hypothetical nodes that we learn in class. This way it shows how the algorithm can be used in real world practice and what the different outcomes could be.
